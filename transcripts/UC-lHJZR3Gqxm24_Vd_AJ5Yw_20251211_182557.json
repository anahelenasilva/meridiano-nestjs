  "transcriptText": "[Music] We're going to Aona. Escape the summer heat. It's September. Still 37° now. It's already colder. So, we're getting a break in the mountains. It's a great day trip. There's a junkyard. Mount Fuji. [Music] Welcome to Hakon. Oh, it's so much colder here. What a difference. This is nice. Oh, really? What do you see? [Music] [Music] [Laughter] Wow, what a bird. [Music] [Music] Thank you. [Music] How did we get the cutest boy in the world? Huh? Let's do that. Oh, just he needs a samurai sword. [Music] [Music] Oh. Oh. Renaissance. That's it. That has to be it. He's alive. Yes. We are at Unisan. It's this really nice bathing place in Hakon. Oh, and they have the best logos ever. You want to go be [Music] I remember we went here a couple year or like a year ago and I was like, \"Ah, Bjon is too small for this area.\" But now he can enjoy it. It's so nice. [Music] [Music] We got the mountain in the back. Big [Music] hi Jojo. [Music] Okay. Okay. You want airplane? Okay. Okay. So, my laptop, my Steam Deck, my phone, my desktop. What do they all have in common? NordVPN. As someone who desperately tries to not have subscription services, I still 100% stand by NordVPN being an amazing product. And here's why. Listen up, buddy. You need to use a VPN if you're connecting to the internet. Otherwise, everyone can see what you're doing. Now, I'm not saying I'm going to download illegal Minecraft mods, but if I do, that's my goddamn business. You hear me? Actually, a friend of mine in Japan was visited by the police because they saw that he was torrenting, which is insane. Internet service providers know everything you're doing unless you use a VPN. So, please do yourself a favor and get one. And if you don't care about privacy, it also keeps you safe online, protecting you from all these different attacks. Another example, friend of mine got hacked because of a man-in-the-middle attack. If he had used NordVPN, this would not have happened. These things happen and they're extremely stressful and frustrating and they shouldn't happen. So just do like me. Always connect to a VPN. I made it here in my way bar and that way you know you're safe. The third reason of course is that it opens up the entirety of the internet as it should be. I recently did a sort of an audit of the sponsorships I've been doing. And even though I keep meaning on subscription services, I don't know how else it would possibly provide a service like this. So I fully stand behind this product. I've been using it myself for years and paying it myself for years and I think it's an important product for the integrity of the internet. So, thank you NordVPN for being an amazing product and an amazing sponsor. If you haven't already, check out the link in the description. If you use the link nordvpn.com/piepie, you get a huge bonus, an additional 4 month for free. Check it out. A 30-day money back guarantee. And they also have a collab with Marvel. I'm not entirely sure why yet, but it looks pretty cool. It's the most random thing I've ever seen, but check it out. Link in the description. Thank you, Noria. Oh my god, that's disgusting.

These videos wouldn't be nothing without Maria editing them. She brings the whole vibe to another level. It's that's just the truth. She does an amazing job.

My editor used to be Cy and he has released a course where you can learn to edit like him. So, if you like my style of editing, check it out. It's great for beginners.

You got to get the Dora and the pizza. The mini pizza. It's like a quarter of a pizza. Ah, 10 differences. It's so difficult. Pause the screen if you want to do it.

Thousands of companies are collecting your private data. They got stuff like your full name, address, phone number. They even got stuff on your relatives. Leave the relatives out of it. They do all this without you agreeing to it. At least I didn't agree to it. Why they do? because they make money of your data. That's my data. That's my money. If you're getting spam calls, that's a dead giveaway that your data has been compromised, for example. Now, the good news is you can opt out of this. You have the legal right to. The bad news, it will take you likely years and a lot of time that you maybe want to spend doing other things. That's where incognito comes in. They go John Wick on these bastards. They do it all for you and you can just watch it all happen while you sit back and relax. If you go to incogn.com/piepie, you get 60% off. That's a great deal. That's practically a steal. And they have a cool new feature where if you have family unlimited plan, you can point to anywhere online where your private data is and that you want removed and they'll do that for you. Seriously amazing. I saw no one who's tried to do that before and just be like, ah, it's too difficult. It's too time consuming and it costs too much money. This is a great deal. So check out incognito.com/pie. Get 60% off. Thank you for sponsoring this video."
