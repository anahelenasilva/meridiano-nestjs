  "transcriptText": "[Music] It's your first day to go to kindergarten today, V. You want to bring that? Yes. P. Can I have some? [Music] The only is in such a hurry. Go to mama. [Music] What is he saying? [Music] Yeah, that's so cool. V, that looks so good. Vienn has started daycare now, by the way. So, he's going two hours to start. And uh cuz we could tell he really really wanted to play with other kids and it's really fun. I think yesterday we could tell how much more comfortable he was with strangers all of a sudden. It was really funny. [Music] We are Where are we? Somewhere around whatever. We're going on a cruise today. We went not long ago and it was so pretty and we were like, \"Okay, we should go back when it's dark out.\" So now we're doing that. It should be very pretty. There's our boat. We are cho like last time. Right on time. Most people are sitting already. Beautiful. This is so nice. And it's still warm outside, too. So, it's nice. So, [Music] this view is crazy. It's so pretty. Wow. I see fish. You guys see it? Whoa. Mine say this new camera. Wait, what is happening? No. What? That's sick. [Music] Our second stop in front of Sky Tree. Damn, so pretty. So full, too. [Music] Good job, Yarn. He ate him. [Music] Who's brave enough now? This guy's brave enough. Here she is. We're going to McDonald's because they have like a ponderable collab decked out. Very cute. Marcia, you said you were you said you you said you were going to meet Pondero. Yeah, that's what Marcia thinks is going on cuz she figured out something was going on. Hey guys, we're waiting for Marcia to surprise her. I'm so nervous. Me, too. We don't know what we're doing yet. We don't know what we're doing. Wait, I want to get it, too. We got him. [Music] Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. [Applause] What's happening? Vinnie coming. Coming. The train is coming. [Music] Whoa. [Music] [Laughter] I want to show you guys something. Here's me installing my kill switch to my Switch 2 by Dbrand. I don't know if you're like me and my dad, we always had this problem where we're grabbing each other's devices. Our Steam Decks looked identical, so we would always have to switch them. So, I put these Dbrand skins on them. M I got the pink one and I got this leather nice feel one. Super nice. Been using it for years. They reached out. I'm like, \"Hell yeah.\" Here's me installing this Switch skin, which is for Kill Switch 2. Look at that. That is so nice. That is genuinely feels so much better to hold. I didn't even know this was a thing. I would have bought this immediately cuz every time I play on the Switch, my these fingers crank up, but they have this uh cover for it to make it more comfortable. The problem with this is that if you get a case like this, you can't put it in the dock. So, they solved that as well where they have literally a dock for it. The other problem is your case doesn't fit. They solve that as well. It comes with a case. I think it looks amazing and it feels genuinely so good. But the best part, they have solved installing protection glass. I am a self-certified expert at putting the protection glass on devices. I do it for me and I do it for March. But there's always one little little smokey splooky right there cuz there's always dust in the air. It doesn't matter how good you are, there's always going to be some splunky right there. Sorry. I was a little skeptical, but I tried it out. I was like, is it on? It looks too good. It can't be on. No way. It's actually on. That's crazy. They solved it. The mad scientist at the brand. I would never bother buying another glass protector. Like this is it. So I slap one on my Switch as well. You just put the thing and you pull the finger and magic. Uh right now Dbrand has a sale 50% off sitewide and they told no BS sell where they sell say that it's 50% but nothing actually good is on sale. They don't do that. The grip case and the prism 40% off which I used here. And the kill switch gaming case $45 off. Check it out. With every order you get free luxury playing cards. If you're like me and enjoy giving your products a boost. I highly highly recommend it. Check out Dbrand in the description. Thank you Dbrand for sponsoring this video. What do you want? Are you ready? Ready. Excuse me. [Music] Pancake cake. Pancake cake. [Music] It's my 111th birthday. Wow. [Music] Yeah. In Sweden, we have a pancok to which is pancake cake. Pancake cake. Can you say pancok? Yeah. Can he go? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think, Beer? Is it good? Good. So busy eating. Second slice be mama. [Music] Thank you. It's finished. Ben, what are you doing? What are you doing? Okay, stop this. It's so late. It's midnight. You're doing so well. You must be so tired. You're holding that for mama. You're so nice. Happy birthday, mama. Thank you. It's officially Mar's birthday. And it will be mama's birthday again when we land. [Music] [Music] [Music] We are landed. That was the easiest flight so far, I think. Right from Mara. She's kind of sick. on my birthday. On your birthday? Bern doesn't usually sleep with me, but he slept all I couldn't believe it. I was like, wait, he slept 8 hours on the plane? Like, [Music] we are in a suburb of Stockholm at a farm. This is supposed to be what we did with Mars for her birthday cuz she just wanted Bernie to be happy, of course. So, this is D and Bernie. And we'll send videos to mama instead. This is so sweetish chickens. A Those are bigger than you are, be [Music] okay. Not closer to my son. Thank you. Hi. Hi, chicken. Hi, chicken. Do you hear the sheep? Yeah, my boy. Let's go. What is that, Baron? What is that? Engine. [Music] He's losing it. [Music] Okay, it's been 30 minutes. We should We should get going. Yes, Ben, get your foot up properly like that. Yes. The other one. The blue one. Yes, Bern. [Music] He covered his head. Good job, Bern. I'm so sad Mart's not here. Mama is so sick. She has 40° fever at home. It feels weirdly um reminiscent or nostalgic to be here. Like [Music] just the nature is so familiar. It's nice. [Music] What is that, Darren? What is it? It's 5:30 in the morning. Got a little jet lag. I've been awake since 3, actually. It's nice and warm, isn't it? A fire. Fire. Yeah, it's a fire. [Music] He's holding in. Thank you. That's how you know you're back home. Is that a camera? Kodak. Yeah. Give it to me nicely. Can you give it to me? Oh, yeah. Good job, Yan. Yan, push me. Oh, thank you. Oh, wow. Oh, thank you. Here we are. Look at this. This looks amazing. Quite cool. Let's go. Go, go, go. You can drive a bus. I know you want to drive the bus. Goodbye. Good job. Yay. Yay. [Music] Can you get me a one? Hey, thank you. Wow. So saddy. [Music] Yes. Good job. Let's do it all together. Three, two, one. [Music] No. [Music] I requested uh for my birthday to have Swedish waffles. None of these Belgian waffles are so they suck. They suck. They're they're soft and lame. These are crispy Swedish waffle. The only good waffle. Remember waffle. I can't wait. I have not had Swedish waffles in forever. I don't know why I thought Swedish waffles were good. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a waffle. Swedish waffle. Swedish waffle. [Music] Swedish nature. Did I mention it yesterday? It was my birthday. I don't know if I mentioned it. I had an amazing birthday. It was so good. In case I didn't say it, I had finally had my Swedish waffles. Delicious. I realized they weren't crispy. They were just thinner. So, that's that. But yeah, today we're going to visit uh some museums for Bern and we're going to see my sister at her place. Oh, you threw it. [Music] What a cute photo. Beautiful. [Music] It's a bird. There it is. Train museum or it's tram museum actually. But he doesn't need to know that. This is how he used to look. 148 crowns for a a puffy jacket. That's crazy. [Music] [Music] Oh my god. [Music] run. [Music] So you compare how fast you are to the train and beans. Break it be for you. Break it be. Look at you. And we got a real for you. Smash it. [Music] Wow, they have bunnies. Bunnies. Oh, so cute. Good job. Bund knew immediately what to do. Afraid at all of them, but they are really He loves feeding animals. I I know Mart is thinking we need to buy bunnies right now. Yeah. Where where should we put them? Yeah, that's a good pile. Be do you want to give it to them? Hi. Oh, wow. Yes. You pet him this way. This way. You better pet. And be careful with the ears. Yes. Like that. Yeah. Good job, Yan. Good. Yeah, [Laughter] you probably haven't seen this, but we would we would I have hours clocked on this game. We play this so Yeah, I bet. I was like, you guys didn't sing yesterday. Wow, looks so good. Beautiful. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. So many toys here. Endless. Oh my god. Excited. I mean, this is so cute. Look at you trog troggling. Oh, megaazoo. We're going to the famous viewing spot in Stockholm. I never actually been to it, but I've seen it many times. So, looking forward to check it out. I was hoping to catch a sunset. Time change. Time changes. Yeah, they changed the time zone. I forget they don't do that in Japan, which is like the best thing ever. You see all of Stockholm, that's really, really cool. Wow. [Music] We made it on top of the mountain. [Music] That's candy times mirror. [Music] You see the airplane here? Where's the airplane? Where is the airplane? Airplane? Yes, I see the airplane. [Music] So excited. Okay, let's go. We are back in Japan. Benn is already napping. It feels like uh we uh we beat the jet lag already. I kind of feel like uh the way to do it is just to make sure you fly overnight cuz you're never going to get a good rest on the flight, but it'll be good enough to keep you going and by the time that you arrive, you're going to if you fly overnight, you will sleep. I I I figured it out. I figured out jet lag. You're welcome, everyone. Uh but it was such an easy flight. Been fell asleep on his own. That has never happened before. I I couldn't believe it. He He must have been taughting at kindergarten, I think. He just fell asleep. I fell asleep before him and he just fell I woke up and I'm like, \"Oh, he fell asleep on his own in the chair.\" He had like cuddled up then everything. It was so cute. He always needs our help, you know, like when you're you're a baby, you always have to help him. But I guess he's old enough. We had an amazing trip in Sweden. Uh but we're always happy to be back in Japan now. It's just so nice here, too. Dress fall. Tresp. [Music] [Music] You always go overboard. We thought we got so much last year. That's right. And they ran out and we were panicking. You're right. I remember now. Mother knows best as always. I'm so curious to see how Bion is going to react to the fact that people are going to ring the door. It's going to be so confusing. Look at this. If I compliment him, he gets really angry. Yes. Okay. No. No. No. It's not good. He turns He turns it off. It sounded good. You want me to go over here? Okay. I I'm not listening. I'm not listening. [Music] But I can wear it. Nothing bad happens. Ben, we can't be the only ones dressed up for Halloween. Come here, Ben. [Music] This is our tile loading animation idol. I mean, okay, so my laptop, my Steam Deck, my phone, my desktop, what do they all have in common? NordVPN. As someone who desperately tries to not have subscription services, I still 100% stand by NordVPN being an amazing product. And here's why. Listen up, buddy. You need to use a VPN if you're connecting to the internet. Otherwise, everyone can see what you're doing. Now, I'm not saying I'm going to download illegal Minecraft mods, but if I do, that's my goddamn business. You hear me? Actually, a friend of mine in Japan was visited by the police because they saw that he was torrenting, which is insane. Internet service providers know everything you're doing unless you use a VPN. So, please do yourself a favor and get one. And if you don't care about privacy, it also keeps you safe online, protecting you from all these different attacks. Another example, friend of mine got hacked because of a man-in-the-middle attack. If he had used NordVPN, this would not have happened. These things happen and they're extremely stressful and frustrating and they shouldn't happen. So just do like me. Always connect to a VPN. I made it here in my way bar and that way you know you're safe. The third reason of course is that it opens up the entirety of the internet as it should be. I recently did a sort of an audit of the sponsorships I've been doing. And even though I keep meaning on subscription services, I don't know how else it would possibly provide a service like this. So I fully stand behind this product. I've been using it myself for years and paying it myself for years and I think it's an important product for the integrity of the internet. So, thank you NordVPN for being an amazing product and an amazing sponsor. If you haven't already, check out the link in the description. If you use the link nordvpn.com/piepie, you get a huge bonus, an additional 4 month for free. Check it out. A 30-day money back guarantee. And they also have a collab with Marvel. I'm not entirely sure why yet, but it looks pretty cool. It's the most random thing I've ever seen, but check it out. Link in the description. Thank you, Norbert."
